## Min cut max flow:
  Ford Fulkersons algorithm - TODO

## Assignment problem
  Minimum total cost: Hungarian algorithms  
  Maximization:  
    - Convert to minimization then use Hungarian  
    - i.e subtract all values with maximum value in the grid, and we get say a loss matrix on which we apply Hungarian. 
    - Step 3 and 4 and final assignment changes
  Unbalanced? Introduce dummy rows/columns with all 0's
